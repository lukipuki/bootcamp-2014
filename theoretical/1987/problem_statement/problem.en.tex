\problemname{From 1987 to 2013}
You might be surprised to know that 2013 is the first year since 1987 with distinct digits. The
years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 each have distinct digits. 2012 does not have distinct
digits, since the digit 2 is repeated.

Given a year, what is the next year with distinct digits?

\section*{Input}
The input starts with integer $N, 1\le N \le 100\,000$ denoting the number of years in the input.
The next $N$ lines contain an integer $Y$ $(0 \le Y \le 10^8)$, representing the starting year.

For partial credit, you may assume that $Y\le 10^6$ and $N\le 10$.

\section*{Output}
For each year $Y$ in the input print a line with integer $D$, which is the next year after $Y$ with
distinct digits.
